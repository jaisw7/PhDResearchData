# PhDResearchData

This is a public repository contaning the research data generated by me during my PhD. The work was supported by [NSF CDS&E grant #1854829](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1854829). The project is open, and technologically not-sensitive. No component of the proposal prohibits public release of research data. Therefore, to ensure research transparency (and also adopt the practice in early part of research career), I have decided to release my data publically. 

### Intellectual Property 

The Intellectual property (IP) rights of several _public_ universities prohibit public disclosure of the research data. To release this data, I have taken approval from the project PI. The members of PhD research committee, Purdue research integrity officer, Head of department (Aeronautics & Astronautics), and dean of engineering at Purdue are aware of this disclosure. It wasn't easy! I believe that this release will make it easier for people to build upon the work that I have spent a considerable effort and time on. 
- The practice is remarkably common in venues like [NIPS](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2020/PaperInformation/CodeSubmissionPolicy), [CVPR](http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/submission/main-conference/author-guidelines). Moreover, public release of research data and code prevents researchers from writing incremental papers. The incremental papers neither push the field forward nor add to our understanding of the reality.
- NSF funds are public money. The work done under NSF projects are done by the people for the people. The public release of research data ensures accountability.

### Contents
