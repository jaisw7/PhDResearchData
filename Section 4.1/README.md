Data files:  

The data files have been named in a format Linf\_mr=x.0\_M=y\_Nrho=Nv.txt where 
- x is the mass ratio of the two species
- y in number of points on the half sphere (Page 38 of the thesis).

In each of the data files, there are three columns. 
- Column 1: Number of points in velocity space (N)
- Column 2: Linf error between the numerical and analytical solution for the first species (equation 4.5 of thesis with i=1).
- Column 3: Linf error between the numerical and analytical solution for the second species (equation 4.5 of thesis with i=2).
