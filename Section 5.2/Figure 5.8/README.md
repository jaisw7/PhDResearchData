This folder contains data for Fig. 5.8 of the thesis.

### Figures:  

The figures have been named in a format AN2\_T\_Speed\_DGFS\_B\_stream.png where 
- A is the pressure in Torr.
- B is the non-dimensional time.

The individal figure files can be found at  
- [Fig. 5.8(a)](966N2_T_Speed_DGFS_50_stream.png)
- [Fig. 5.8(b)](966N2_T_Speed_DGFS_100_stream.png)
- [Fig. 5.8(c)](966N2_T_Speed_DGFS_150_stream.png)

### Data files:  

The DGFS data files are contained in the directory dgfs. This files can be opened in tecplot. The files have been named in a format bulksol_dgfs_2d_mikra_str-B.0.vtu where 
- B is the non-dimensional time (same as above)

Here the file prefix have been named with the following rationale:
- *bulksol* refers to bulk property i.e., moments of the distribution. 
- *dgfs* refers to the name of the solver, for example dgfs refers to single-species solver, whereas dgfsbi refers to multi-species
- *2d* refers to 2-dimensional physical space
- *mikra* refers to the name of the test case
